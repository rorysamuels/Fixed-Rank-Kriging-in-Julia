# Fixed Rank Kriging in Julia
An implementation of [fixed rank kriging](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/70/1/209/7109391) for massive spatial datasets in the Julia langauage. This implementation is integrated with [Uberâ€™s Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index (H3)](https://www.uber.com/blog/h3)). 

See [interactive_example.jl](https://github.com/rorysamuels/Fixed-Rank-Kriging-in-Julia/blob/main/Interactive_Example.jl) for a walkthrough of the main functions.
